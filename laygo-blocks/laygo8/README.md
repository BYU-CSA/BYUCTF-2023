# Laygo8
Level - Medium

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 7/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Awesome, everything looks good! As one last job, we'd like to make sure we don't get compromised again, and as a favor to our friend, we'd like to give them a gift. We want you to create a Yara rule that will detect all webshells generated by this guy, but not have any false positives. Can you do that?
