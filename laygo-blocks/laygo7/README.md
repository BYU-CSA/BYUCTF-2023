# Laygo7
Level - Medium

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 7/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Also, now that you have access to their machine, would you be able to decrypt the command output from that network traffic? I just want to tie up all the loose ends here. A friend of ours in the threat intel community said they've been tracking this hacker, and managed to get some of their source code used in creating these unique web shells, hopefully it can help you.
