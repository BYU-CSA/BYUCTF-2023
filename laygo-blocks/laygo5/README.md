# Laygo5
Level - Medium

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 5/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Thanks for decrypting that code! Can you figure out what commands were sent to the reverse shell now?
