# Laygo6
Level - Medium

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 6/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Crap, they stole some of our data! We've got to get it back! Luckily, we know that the attacker's home is located at ??link??. Can you hack them back and retrieve what they stole?
