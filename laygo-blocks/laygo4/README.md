# Laygo4
Level - Medium

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 4/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Alright, it looks like a good chunk of the code in the reverse shell is encrypted or something because you can't read it. I want to make sure we understand exactly what happened here. Luckily, I regularly take network traffic samples for cases just like this, you can find it below. Can you figure out what's inside the encrypted code in the reverse shell?
