# Laygo1
Level - Easy

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 1/8 in the Laygo Series.
------------------------------
Hey, thanks for helping us out! We think we got hacked, can you help us? We found this file left on our webserver, but don't know what it says. Can you read it?
