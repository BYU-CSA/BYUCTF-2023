# Laygo3
Level - Easy

Description:
```
LaygoBlocks, LLC is a small company that makes building blocks called "Laygos" that kids can use to create all sorts of things (totally unrelated to LEGO). They've only been out for a little bit, and recently found out that they were hacked (they think?) and have hired you to figure out what happened.

This is challenge 3/8 in the Laygo Series.

Thanks for figuring out that message! That's not good that they compromised our web server, and I'm not sure where they got in. We've zipped up our source code for our website below, can you find which of our files allowed the attacker to upload a reverse shell?
