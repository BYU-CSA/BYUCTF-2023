# MI6configuration
Level - Hard

Description:
```markdown
We recently acquired a computer at MI6 and it seems like they might have made some mistakes. Can you hack it using their misconfigurations and get all their important data? (Download the VM file and power it on. Find the IP address and start hacking!)

*Note - there are 3 flags, flag2 does not exist*
